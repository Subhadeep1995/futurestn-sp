      <h1>Climate Risk - TCFD</h1>

      <p>
        The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) develops
        voluntary, consistent climate-related financial risk disclosures for use
        by companies in providing information to investors, lenders, insurers,
        and other stakeholders.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Task Force considers the physical, liability and transition risks
        associated with climate change and what constitutes effective financial
        disclosures across industries.
      </p>

      <p>
        The work and recommendations of the Task Force helps firms understand
        what financial markets want from disclosure in order to measure and
        respond to climate change risks, and encourage firms to align their
        disclosures with investors’ needs.
      </p>

        Managing the environmental and social risk of business has become a
        challenge over the years with stringency in formulating and implementing
        environmental and social rules by the regulators worldwide and the
        stakeholders (primarily investors and society) becoming conscious and
        concerned.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Regulators :</b> The rules and standards are becoming more and more
        stringent globally across the supply chains. Obtaining / retaining
        permits and licenses to operate are getting difficult for businesses. On
        the positive side, this is helping in reduction of losses due to E&S
        risks, supply chain risks and credit risks.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Investors :</b> Both the suppliers of equity and debt capitals are
        reviewing the E&S risks before investing. While the Banks and Financial
        Institutions are more and more demanding evidence based risk management
        systems, shareholders are demanding additional environmental and social
        disclosures in the forms of sustainability reports / integrated reports/
        ESG reports. There has been a significant rise in
        <b>Sustainable financing</b> [refers to any form of financial service
        integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria into the
        business or investment decisions for the lasting benefits]. Till
        recently, investors were interested in only profits and return on
        investment. Things are changing, albeit gradually, with investors
        becoming concerned about environmental and ethical investing. At the
        same time, civil society has campaigned actively on the urgency to act
        on climate change. Policymakers, too, have started guiding sustainable
        finance.
      </p>

      <b>Our Services :</b>
      (a) Environmental and Social Risk Assessment of supply chain <br />
      (b) Gap Analysis between Environmental and Social Risk Management System
      (if any) and practice <br />
      (c) Portfolio Risk Assessment for banks / financial institutions <br />
      (d) Risk audit with respect to IFC Performance Standards <br />
      (e) Training to develop systems complying with IFC Performance Standards.

      (f) Improvement of ESG Rating by independent rating agencies like S&P’s
      Dow Jones <br />
      Sustainability Index, MSCI, FTSE Russell and similar agencies. <br />
