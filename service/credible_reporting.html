      <h2>An increasing need from investors for more information</h2>

      <p>
        Over the past four decades, reporting has evolved in response to
        organizations’ focus on addressing investors’ demand for more
        information. However, despite this evolution, research indicates that
        investors believe disclosure shortfalls remain, especially in the
        reporting of strategy, risks and future performance. Also, non-financial
        information, which is often disclosed in different ways, is not easily
        comparable between organizations. The need for more information related
        to Environmental and Social Governance (ESG) was never in such demand
        earlier
      </p>

      <p>
        Investors agree that ESG aspects present risks and opportunities that
        have been neglected for too long and also assert that sustainable
        returns require a sharper focus on corporate governance, environmental
        and social considerations. The importance of disclosure and scrutiny of
        non-financial information is set to grow in the years ahead. There is a
        growing belief among investors about recent environmental and social
        scandals driving a need to re-evaluate non-financial disclosures and the
        information already available. Investors believe the biggest motivator
        for companies to report ESG information is its potential to impact
        companies’ reputation among their customers and regulators.
      </p>

      <h2>A new mandatory requirement in India</h2>

      <p>
        The market regulator SEBI has mandated the top 1000 listed companies to
        publish Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) from
        the FY 2022-23 onwards every year. This is a significant development
        that would demand ESG disclosures from these companies and aimed at
        interest of investors.
      </p>

      <p>
        The quantitative and standardized disclosure parameters will enable ESG
        performance comparability among companies, sectors and time. Such
        disclosures will help investors make informed decisions. This will
        particularly help responsible investors who invest with motive of both
        profit and purpose.
      </p>

      <h2>Possible challenges</h2>

      <p>
        Such comprehensive, detailed and quantitative ESG related disclosures
        are now mandated for the first time. Majority of the Indian listed
        companies may face challenges in developing the BRSR in the initial
        years.
      </p>

      <h2>How we add value</h2>

      <p>
        Our professionals have been supporting clients in disclosing ESG
        information as per GRI / CDP / TCFD / SASB / IR and similar
        standards/guidelines/frameworks. They can support in developing the
        BRSR.
