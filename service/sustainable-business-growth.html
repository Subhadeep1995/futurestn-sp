      <h2>ES6 and Resilience</h2>

      <p>
        Integration of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) aspects into
        long-term business strategy and growth plans is becoming increasingly
        important. A well defined ESG strategy enables an organization to devise
        a road map that considers its stakeholders’ views, is realistic and
        provides measurable sustainability metrics to track its performance
        against its stated goals. This creates sustainable value for the
        company’s stakeholders while improving its bottom line. A business at a
        high level of ESG maturity is more resilient to risks and disruptions.
      </p>

      <p>
        We co-develop the ESG risk and opportunities of our clients’ businesses
        and leverage these while putting in place well-designed strategies that
        incorporate a well-accepted methodology. The process of developing a
        thought through ESG strategy is founded on an understanding and
        measurement (wherever appropriate) of an organization’s internal “as is”
        situation across all material ESG risks and opportunities.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a next step periodic improvement targets are set for all the ESG
        metrics, granular action plans are developed, implemented, monitored and
        corrective actions are taken in case of slippages. The client
        organization thus develops better resilience.
      </p>

      <p>
        As is evident from the service description, these are long terms
        associations with clients spanning over 2 to 3 years.
      </p>

      <h2>ESG/CDP Rating or Score</h2>

      <p>
        More and more responsible investors and customers are trying to find out
        the ESG related information of potential investee / supplier before
        their investment / procurement decisions. The most popular sources of
        credible information for them is available from CDP and ESG rating
        agencies like S&P’s DJSI, MSCI, FTSE Russell etc. These agencies source
        credible information about the ESG performance from companies, analyze
        them, rate /score them and make them available to potential investors
        and customers.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is particularly important for the companies to provide the CDP and
        other ESG rating agencies the most appropriate credible information for
        this purpose. A good rating or score make them more attractive towards
        investors and customers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each agency has their rating or scoring methodology. It is important for
        the companies to understand the process and provide information
        appropriately.
      </p>

      <h3>What value we add</h3>
      We support our clients to respond to the questionnaire of CDP or rating
      agencies with an aim to obtain the best rating/score under the given
      circumstances and status of their ESG performance. Our professionals have
      developed this skill based on years of experience in doing similar work
      and their knowledge of the rating/scoring processes followed by each
      agency.

      <h2>Product Stewardship</h2>

      <p>
        Developing products based on improved ESG performance over the life
        cycle is something that is getting focus in the recent years. This is
        becoming a differentiator in the market.
      </p>

      <p>
        Things like product carbon and water footprints are established
        differentiators for responsible consumers. Carbon or energy saving
        during life cycle usage at customers’ end is getting focus of late.
      </p>

      <p>
        So proper positioning of the product in the market, making optimal use
        of these ESG aspects, is something that may be judiciously highlighted
        while marketing the products if a company has such attributes in its
        products. So, in addition to traditional parameters like quality, price
        and delivery, ESG attributes is the new parameter that influences buying
        decisions of consumers.
      </p>

      <h3>What value we add</h3>
      <p>
        We support our clients with life cycle studies and appropriate analysis
        to bring out the positive ESG aspects in the products so that these can
        be used while positioning the products in the market.
      </p>

      <h2>UN SDG Alighnment</h2>
      <p>
        WBCSD has come out with several sectoral roadmaps for UN SDGs. Similar
        roadmaps for the remaining important sectors are under development.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Our Services :</b> After studying the business case and growth plan,
        we support our clients in developing their strategies to align with the
        sectoral roadmaps or goals of the material SDGs. All such alignments
        have business cases for long term sustainable benefits to business and
        stakeholders
